Rootkit - Malware that modify files in the kernel of the OS. It's becoming a part of OS therefore it is invisible for anti-virus/anti-malware software.
Good example of malware with rootkit is Zeus/Zbot malware. It was used to clean out bank accounts. Combined with Necrus rootkit it is very hard to delete. 
You can't even stop this process becouse it is a system process (Error terminating process: Access denied)

Finding and removing rootkits:
    Use remover specific to the rootkit.
    Secure boot with UEFI - it looks if any part of kernel has been changed and won't boot a system that may have been modified.
